CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program? Personal Finance Budgeter

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve? My program will help the people to organized in the personal finances.


3. What will you learn from developing this program? I need to learn about tkinter, pandas, numpy, muttlib too.

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    The modules i could use are:
    
    -datetime
    -pytest
    -sqlite3
    -tkinter


5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

    I will create some functions to resolve the problem:

    -Get the user data (and save it in a list)
    -Control the finances from a list (database)
    -Edit items
    -Delete items
    -Show a total (in positive or negative)
    -Have a login (user:ezequieltartaglia/password:ezequieltartaglia)
    -Other necesaries to improve the program

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

    I tried to think if i could use test, but i don't know in what part (i tried to use some functions but i didn't realize was necesary in this project)
